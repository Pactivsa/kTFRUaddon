betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFg.name=Tier - Arrival
betterquesting.questline.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAFg.desc=You landed your shuttle on a Terrafirma's plain called Novosibirsk. Be alive before you do anything else!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.name=The Stone Age
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.desc=Oh, I have a terrible headache. I must have not recovered from the high frequency oscillation of the atmospheric brake. By the way, I think I should make the most basic tools, now I only have the stones.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ.name=Clay
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQ.desc=Unlike vanilla, the clay blocks are covered by grass in this pack. But you can spot them with the goldenrod growing on top, a pretty yellow flower. Go get a ton of them! (not the flower, of course)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg.name=Pottery
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAg.desc=Now it's time to make some pottery using the same interface you used to make stone tool heads. To open the clay molding GUI, you must right-click with five or more clay clumps in hand. The raw clay products need to be fired into finished ceramics before they can be used. You may wonder how to do it.  You need a "pit kiln". %n%nSteps:%n1.Dig a 1x1x1 dirt pit, then shift-right click to place 4 clay items you want to fire. Shift right click again with an empty hand to pick them back up. %n2. Have 8 pieces of straw in your hand and right click the bottom of the pit until the pit is half full. Aim at the ground, not the item. %n3. Fill in 8 pieces of wood on the straw until the pit is full and light it with the fire starter. %n4. Once the fire burns out, you can collect your ceramics by hand, or simply break the bottom of the klin to collect everything. %n%nAn important thing to understand is that the flame burning on a clay kiln ignites nearby flammable blocks. For this reason, it is not recommended to set up the klin in houses made of wood, hay or other flammable materials. However, the kiln will not be extinguished by the rain.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAw.name=Novosibirsk grows potatoes
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAw.desc=This Modpack is a tribute to all those who have made contributions to the space industry. Your contributions will never be forgotten. %n%nMy name is Alexander Steve II. I am the son (daughter) of my father Alexander Steve I. My father is one of the seniors in GregTech Co.Ltd. Inc. But I didn't want to live in my father's shadow, so I took part in a great mission: Intergalacticalization of GregTech. %n%n Twenty years ago, astronomers found that 68 light-years from Earth in the DSB-1 planetary system, there is an exoplanet at the outer edge of the habitable zone- a gas giant - known as Duck Egg. But some people suggested that the planet's moons are likely to receive from the planet's infrared radiation to gain enough energy to produce an environment suitable for living lives. The largest of these moons is called Terrafirma. %n%nThe company took the discovery seriously: substantial resources were devoted to the construction of an interplanetary spaceship, GTSS Limitless Empire, whose goal was to lead a team of top GregTech employees to colonize the exo-moon. The Chairman of GregTech called the plan "the first step in the pan-galactic evolution of GregTech Co.Ltd. Inc." I was selected as a member of the colonial team because of my excellent physical and technical abilities. In 1859, Pan Galactic GregTech Technology Co., Ltd. launched the interstellar settlement program. I hibernated for 200 years in Limitless Empire and arrived in the DSB-1 planetary system. Ages have passed when we reached the Terrafirma. But what woke me up was not the call of my teammates. It was a shrill siren. I looked around to see in shock my teammate had a piece of glass in his chest, and I heard him say in a voice like a mosquito, "You go, this ship is going to crash. I have the keys to the escape pod and the science guide of the Empire. I wish you a good life." Then he closed his eyes forever, and I laid his body flat on the ground and took his keys and his guide. Got into the escape pod and enter the unknown world, I named the landing site Novosibirsk, picked up my potato seeds, put on my antifreeze, and opened the hatch. Looking at the huge moon hanging overhead and the blue sun, I silently set a goal: return to Earth! %n%n A self-rescue journey has officially BEGUN! %n%n Click the red "X" on the right side to complete the task %n%nÂ§ C Important: the red word is important! %n%n Important: click the item needed by the task to view the item synthesis! %n%n Important: Crown shaped quests are the main quests that unlock the next phase, rounded quests are the side quests! %n%n Important: The task line at the beginning of Tier is the "main tech line", which is what you must complete to pass this integrated package. However, other task lines also contain a lot of integrations! %n%n(please check the description of each task carefully, they cost me a lot of effort)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA.name=Cut down a tree
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABA.desc=As you may have already discovered, your strength has weakened, and the trees of this world can no longer be mined with bare hands. You need to make a stone axe head to cut down a tree. Fortunately, all you have to do is break the bottom log and then the whole tree will fall.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABw.name=Want to cut down a tree?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABw.desc=With stones, you can enter the Paleolithic age. %n%nTo cut down a tree, you need a stone axe, not a hand. Now make some stone tool heads. %n%nWhen you hold two or more stones, right-clicking will open up the knapping GUI to shape a stone into the tool head. %n%nThe tool head can then be attached to a stick to create a stone tool. Armor, chisel, mace, pick, mining pick, saw, sickle, and sword can't be made of stone.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA.name=Stone Anvil
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACA.desc=The stone anvil is obtained by right clicking on an igneous intrusive or igneous extrusive rock with a hammer. It will have a dent when compared to other stones. Right-click the anvil to open the GUI and place the hammer inside so that the anvil won't revert to a regular stone. %n%nIntrusive rocks: diorite, gabbro, granite %nIgneous rocks: andesite, basalt, dacite, rhyolite
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACg.name=Smelting Ore
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACg.desc=Ceramic vessels (also known as pottery jars) can be used to refine primary copper, tetrahedrite or malachite to produce pure copper. To do this, store the ore in a pot (different minerals can be put in the same pot to make alloy) and then heat it in a clay kiln. %n%nAfter firing, retrieve the jar from the kiln and right-click it to open its GUI. Now you'll see that instead of the usual four slots, the jar has only one slot and contains info about the amount of metal it contains. Be careful though, the metal will remain in liquid form for only about 10 minutes. If the metal inside solidifies, you have to put it back into a kiln to melt it down again. %n%nNote: cans with molten metal inside will have a white "liquid" tooltip. %n%nRight click with the vase in hand when you are ready to pour the metal into formms. Put the pickaxe mold or other molds into the GUI that opens, and you can get your first metal pickaxe!%n%n=============================   %n%nCeramic vessels also can be used to make bronze, black bronze, and bismuth bronze. %n%nPlace the necessary ore in a ceramic vessel with proper ratio to make the desired copper alloy. For example, if you want to make ordinary bronze, you can put copper ore (any native copper, malachite or tetrahedrite) and cassiterite in ceramic vessels. For each alloy, there is a range of ratios you can meet to produce the desired alloy, so as long as you are within the range, you don't have to reach the exact ratio.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADw.name=One cup of water a day keeps doctor away
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADw.desc=You notice that you now have a thirst bar. Well, it makes sense, right? %n%nYou can right-click a fresh water block and drink from it directly (fresh water lakes have reeds) or fill this water bottle with water. %n%nEvery time you use a ceramic product, it may break. The odds are different for each product. When things break, they make a crisp sound.%n
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJQ.name=Time for a REAL Forge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJQ.desc=Make a 1x1x1 pit where all 5 blocks contacting the pit are some variation of stone.  Place 8 charcoal in the pit (right click 8 times). Then use a fire starter or a flint & steel to make a forge furnace block. %n%nIn the forge GUI, where a ghost coal icon is displayed in the forge furnace, you may place charcoal. The five spots above these are for holding the metal that needs to be heated. As the temperature rises, the color of the metal changes (you can't tell, but it's shown below the item), and the item becomes "workable," then "weldable," then "dangerous." Be careful when the metal goes into the "dangerous" state, as further heating may cause your metal to melt. %n%nWhen the metal becomes liquid, if there is an ingot mould in the five columns on the right, the molten metal will enter the mould; if there is no mould, the metal will disappear directly. If the temperature continues to rise, the metal may be lost entirely.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATg.name=Metal Welding
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAATg.desc=Open your stone anvil with a hammer in the lower left corner, flux in the lower right corner, and two pieces of metal that have been heated to "weldable" temperature in the upper left corner. Click "Weld" to weld two pieces of metal together, consuming one flux and one durability from the hammer.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVw.name=Nutrition
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAVw.desc=Terrafirma B is not a friendly place. First, food in this world rots quickly. Also, to the right of the bar you can see your five nutrient categories -- grains, vegetables, protein, dairy, and fruit. The lack of nutrients in any category will gradually reduce your maximum health, although maintaining high levels of nutrients in each category or gaining experience can increase maximum health. To accomplish this, you will have to collect all kinds of wild crops that grow on the ground and farm them, you have to kill wildlife for protein, you have to find fruit trees, and you have to raise cows for dairy . Staying full and hydrated helps you avoid all kinds of negative effects.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdg.name=Portable workbench
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAdg.desc=In NEI, search for the TFC workbench. You can upgrade the 2x2 grid in inventory to a 3x3 grid directly after making it. Be aware that you lose that upgrade after you die, and you can only recover that by re-entering the game.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhA.name=Use NEI
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAhA.desc=Open the item bar and press 'O' to toggle NEI on and off. In the bottom left, you can find the button for changing NEI options.  %nWithin an NEI recipe page, you may use the mousewheel to find other recipes that use the same machine.  The < and > buttons at the bottom of the page do this also.  %nAt the top of the page you will find another set of < and > buttons, and these will allow you to see other machines (or recipe classes) that can do the same thing.  %nThe alloy smelting pages are extremely detailed.  For example, for the alloying of bronze from copper or tin powder, you will see in the lower left corner details of the necessary temperature (in Kelvin), and the necessary proportion ranges for each ingredient (showing a minimum and maximum percentage).   Have fun!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAiQ.name=Multiplayer servers
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAiQ.desc=If you're playing on a multiplayer server, you can go to the item bar, which has a map icon in the upper left corner, and open it to claim chunks. %n%n The Map icon above the green man can be used to add friends and to give permissions.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAnQ.name=You can finally make boards...
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAnQ.desc=Use a saw to make wood planks.  You'll need them for chests and workbenches.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAow.name=Geological prospecting - information currently available
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAow.desc=Â§o Unlike the original world you are familiar with, the underground world of The Sierra Star becomes more complex and real. Rock formations consist of a large number of rocks of the same kind. The crust here is very thick, 130 to 150 meters thick. Â§r %n%nRock is produced in three different vertical strata. Sedimentary rocks can only be found at the top. Metamorphic rocks occur in the upper and middle layers. All three layers have igneous intrusive rocks and igneous extrusive rocks. Each layer is independent of the others, so a change in the stone on the surface does not necessarily mean a change in the other two layers of stone.%n%n Â§3Igneous intrusive rocks: Diorite, gabbro, granite%n%n Â§4Igneous extrusive rock: Andesite, basalt, dacite, rhyolite%n%nÂ§6Sedimentary rocks: Chalk, chert, clay, conglomerate, dolomite, limestone, rock salt, shale. %n%n Â§eÂ§7Â§dMetamorphic rocks: Gneiss, marble, phyllite, quartzite, schist, slate %n%n Â§rÂ§oYou can make flux of any rock with calcium carbonate as the main ingredient: Â§aDolomite, limestone, chalk, and marble. %n%nÂ§rYou can make salt with any rock with sodium chloride as the main ingredient: Rock salt %n%nÂ§rStones found on the surface have the same texture as the top layer below them. If there are mineral veins nearby, loose rocks are likely to produce a nugget of the mineral rather than rock. These mineral nuggets represent the existence of a mineral vein on the same y-axis as the nugget. %n%nGraphite is produced in metamorphic and sedimentary rocks; kaolinite is produced in metamorphic and sedimentary rocks; diamonds are produced in basalt, phyllite, and diorite; and tin and uranium are produced in all igneous and intrusive rocks. %n%nThe location of other minerals will need to be explored by you. Minerals such as rutile, tungstate and zircon are not found in the barren Sierra Star and you will need to make a rocket to their moons to obtain them.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA3w.name=Starting Fires
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA3w.desc=Once it is evening, it is time for this task. The main way to collect sticks is to break the leaves. A leaf has about a third chance of dropping a stick. Using a sickle can break a 3x3x3 block of leaves centered around the broken block, making it more efficient, but the drop rate will be reduced to one-tenth. Hitting a piece of wood with a hammer will drop 1-3 sticks. %n%nTo create a bonfire, throw three sticks at a square (default 'q'), then use a fire-starter or flint to continuously right light the top of the square. %n%nFire starters can be used to light several types of fire in TFC, including bonfires, charcoal pits and kilns. When igniting fires, the starter may need to be used multiple times to successfully ignite the flame, and depending on random chance, more than one fire starter may be required. In addition, a fire starter can activate a forge or blast furnace.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4A.name=Panning for gold (copper)
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4A.desc=Find a beach near the water, right-click the sand with a panning pan, and then keep right-clicking on the flowing water, and you have a good chance of getting some good stuff, including copper. %n%nNote that the sand will disappear if you use it too much.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABDw.name=Straw
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABDw.desc=Straw is obtained by cutting grass with a knife or sickle around the world. Each block of grass drops a stalk of straw. Straw is also produced as a by-product when refining grain. %n%nStraw can also be recovered from its thatch form. %n%nThatch blocks are some of the first roof tiles in the game. Unlike dirt and stone, thatch is not affected by gravity, so it can be used to make roofs. However thatch cannot be used effectively as walls, since players (and monsters) can move right through it.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEA.name=The Bonfire
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEA.desc=Bonfires are created by dropping three sticks on the ground and using a flint or a fire starter and right clicking on the square below them. Using a fire starter may require several attempts to ignite successfully. Throwing a straw on it will make the fire ignite more easily. Campfires exposed directly to precipitation will not consume fuel and will eventually go out. To prevent this, a block should be placed over the campfire to protect it. %n%nOnce the bonfire is ignited, it will burn out quickly unless more fuel (logs) are added. To reignite it, have at least one piece of fuel in the fuel slots and right-click the campfire with the ignitor or flint. %n%nBonfires are used to make torches, cook food, and heat starter items.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFA.name=Charcoal
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABFA.desc=Notice the difference between Vanilla and TFC Charcoals. (If you don't have a home yet, come back to this task later) %n%nHow does one make charcoal? You need a charcoal pit! %n%nSneak with a log in your hand and right click to get a pile of logs. Click again with an empty hand to put in up to 16 logs. The smallest version of a charcoal pit is a single pile of wood with four logs to ensure that at least one piece of charcoal is produced. In general, you want many piles of wood together.  There is no maximum. %n%nCover the wood with dirt or gravel.  Make a hole in the top of the pile, and drop a torch on the exposed log pile to ignite it. Then seal it with dirt. %n%nPlayers will have about 10 seconds after the fire ignites to close the pit entirely. %n%nOnce the charcoal pit catches fire, it must be covered with any non-flammable solid blocks keep it smouldering. Any exposed pile of logs will burn and eventually drop the logs, causing the process to fail. If the process is successful, smoke particles will be released from the covered pit. After 18 hours of play time, the smoke particles will dissipate and the smouldering logs will be turned into charcoal blocks that can be harvested one at a time with a shovel. Note: Only a full log pile can have another log pile on it, so plan the height accordingly. %n%nIf there is a gravitation affected block in the top layer of the pit, such as dirt or cobblestone, these blocks will collapse because air blocks are created when logs turn into charcoal. Most of the larger charcoal pits are made of stone and brick to provide a more durable structure.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABGQ.name=Check the material content
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABGQ.desc=Press F3 + H to turn on the display of the IDs for items, as well as show values for durability and other details.  %n%nThis will be very useful for when you begin working with GregTech.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABIA.desc=Thanks to McMod.cn for the GregTech tutorial.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABJQ.name=About unlocking chapters
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABJQ.desc=Rather than having each chapter unlock simply by finishing the previous chapter, the chapters in this book are more like a collection of tasks. The most important purpose of the chapter is to guide you through many aspects of the gameplay in this mod pack. %n%n For example, when you unlock the hoe, you unlock the agricultural quest line. When you unlock the steel, you unlock the Steam Age quest line.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMw.name=About the inability to view forge
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABMw.desc=All forging recipes are in JEI, but they are not connected to the required tier of anvil.%n%nIt is due to a multi-world plugin.%n%nThe forging formulas do show the tier of anvil required in text at the top.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABXA.name=Simple climbing up and down
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABXA.desc=If you have plenty of straw, this rope is much cheaper than a ladder.%n%nYou can climb up and down on it as you build a mineshaft, without having to dig stepped tunnels that might collapse. %n %nClick on the top to collect all pieces of the rope.%n%nRight click on the existing rope to extend it down.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABcQ.name=Looking for metal nuggets
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABcQ.desc=Some of the stones on the ground are special. Start by looking for native copper nuggets, small tetrahedrite, or small malachite -- these are copper nuggets, each containing 10 units of copper. Please pick up at least ten copper nuggets.%n
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABcg.name=Â§bÂ§lEverything You Know is Wrong
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABcg.desc=TFC is frequently called a survival-overhaul mod. This essentially means that it completely changes the original world! %n%nEverything you remember about MC survival mode does not apply here. Remember, the quest book is always your best helper. When you have any questions, please see if there is an answer in the quest book. %n%nTo get started, pick up some stones and sticks from the ground. Any variety of stone can be used to complete this task. Well, seems like there are some bread in the shuttle.

Right click to place him, and right click again to play.  Once placed, he can't be removed.  Remember to keep him at home!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABzA.name=What should I dig for?
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABzA.desc=After getting your first pick, you can mine ore from the rock instead of collecting the ore nuggets from the earth's surface. %n%nAfter finding nuggets on the ground, you can use the prospecting pick (propick) I gave you, right click on the dirt nearby, and feedback text will tell you how much minerals there are. %n%nThe propick works on a 25x25x25 cube centered on the square you hit. %n%nPersonal recommendation on how to use it:%n%nFirst locate a location that shows "A very large sample". (if there is no very large sample at the surface, you may need to dig down)%n%nNext choose a direction, such as the x axis, and continue prospecting in this line, until you get a reading other than "very large sample"%n%nFor example, let's say that you get a "very large sample" at x=190 and x=210, but everything west of 190 and east of 210 is "large sample" or smaller.  In this example, the center of the vein would be where x = 200.%n%nAfter you have discovered the center of the vein with regard to x, do the same again with regards to z.  Do this by prospecting north and south in a line where your x-center was.%n%nAfter you have the center of the vein, dig down until you find the ore.%n%nPlease note that the propick frequently gives false negatives.  When you see that the pick finds nothing, it just means that block will never give information.  You'll have to work with the information you do get, and ignore the negatives.  Likewise, sometimes the pick will find a different vein than what you searching for.  In fact, having too many other types of veins in the same area can make prospecting very difficult.%n%nThis process works well on flat land without other veins around.  In most cases, you will have hills that interfere.  Remember that you can use your pick on any solid block.  You may need flatten some terrain in some cases.%n%nIt is recommended that you use mine copper, coal, tin, zinc, and bismuth in Tier 1.  You will need a large amount of iron starting in tier 3, so it won't hurt to pick it up also if you find it.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABzQ.name=Columns
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABzQ.desc=You may have noticed that the stone in this world will often collapse, and you have to do something to prevent that. %n%nWith a saw you can make supports (NEI search supports). Any log can make supports, and their combined effect is to prevent the cave from collapsing. %n%nIn the cave you need to lay them out in the following shape (side view): %nSupport: V%nStones: S%n%nS S S%nV V V%nV   V%nV   V%nS S S %n%n They can hold up 7x7x3 squares above.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVg.name=Difficulty mode
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACVg.desc=There are two levels of difficulty in this pack: normal mode and expert mode. Normal mode is on by default. This mode reduces some material consumption, allows some devices like GT Anvil to be used, and etc. but the overall gameplay remains the same. We suggest you use expert mode. %n%n Use /FTB_mode set Normal to switch to normal mode. %n%n Use /FTB_mode Set Expert to switch to expert mode. %n%n If you are playing on the server, only an administrator can switch the difficulty mode.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaw.name=Task team
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACaw.desc=The team forming system can be found in the selection interface when the task book is opened.%n Due to the limitation of the task book, the team forming system cannot team across tasks, and the team forming system is to complete tasks synchronously.%n%nÂ§fÂ§ C * In other words, you must start with the same task starting point when you team up.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA2g.name=Leather
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA2g.desc=Hides are shed by pigs, cattle, deer, and sheep whose wool has been sheared. They come in three sizes: small, medium, and large. Each animal loses only one hide, but bigger animals drop larger hides. It takes a barrel containing limewater to change the hide into a soaked hide. Once the barrel contains the amount of limewater you need, place the hide in the barrel and seal it. You will not be able to open the barrel until the whole process is complete. Once finished, the soaked hide appears in the barrel. %n%nScraping hides requires a leather rack. First of all, the logs need to be placed on ground. Then, by shift-right-clicking, you can place the soaked hide on the log (on the top of the log, not the sides or undersides!) Scrape each part clean with a knife. Finally, the hide can be removed from the logs. %n%nIt takes a barrel of water to change the scraped hide into a prepared. Once you have filled the barrel with the desired amount, put the skins into the barrel and seal them. You will not be able to open the barrel until the whole process is complete. Once finished, prepared hide will appear in the barrel. %n%nPrepared hide is used to make leather. It will take a barrel of tannin. Fill the barrel with the required amount, place the prepared hide into the barrel and seal it. You will not be able to open the barrel until the whole process is complete. Once finished, the barrel will contain leather. %n%nA larger hide requires more tannin, but produces more leather. %n%nNote that not all logs can be used to create tannin.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABuA.name=Metal forging
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABuA.desc=Look at the central part of the anvil. These are the actions related to forging. Â§r%n%n*I suggest screenshotting the anvil gui, and having it open as a reference as you read this quest.* %n%nFirst look at the middle section, the two squares on the left are the raw materials you use for forging. Metals can be heated to "can work" and then forged on anvil. An anvil can forge only materials of its own tier or lower (for example, a bronze anvil can work bronze and copper). The button to the right of the middle two squares is the "plan selector" button, select the finished product you want to forge here. %n%nAfter selecting the desired finished product, look at the three orange-red boxes at the top. From left to right are the last, second to last, and third to last operations. Remember them. %n%nNext look down, in the middle and down there are 8 buttons, 4 red and 4 green.  Hovering over a button will show you what that button will do.  %n%nFurther down, the bottom of the center has a bar with a red arrow on top and a green arrow on bottom. You can move the green arrow by pressing the 8 action buttons. All you have to do is align the red and green, and make sure that the last three actions are consistent with the three rules at the top.%n%nThe eight kinds of actions for the movement of the green arrow direction and distance are different: %n%nÂ§cÂ§4 Light Hit: 3 units left %nMedium hit: 6 units left %nHeavy hit: 9 units left %nPull: 15 units left. %n%nÂ§aPunch: 2 units to the right%nBend: 7 units to the right %nUpset: 13 units to the right%nShrink: 16 units to the right Â§r%n%nBe careful not to let the green arrow to move off the right side, or metal will disappear. %n%nI suggest that red and green arrows should be aligned first, and then the total displacement of the last three operations should be calculated. The distance between the two arrows should be opposite to the total displacement by operation, and then the final product can be produced by the last three operations. %n%nIf the metal is cold, warm it in the forge for a bit, then go back to forging.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACw.name=Â§bÂ§lMetal Smelting
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACw.desc=Want to temporarily say farewell to the anvil processing? This GregTech cauldron is your best helper. Note: this crucible cannot process the original ore you dug! You must process the raw ore into crushed ore/washed ore/ore powder, or turn them into single metallic substance before you can melt it. For now, the crucible's biggest use will be making alloys. The crucible made it easier to make complex alloys such as black, blue and red steel. Usage: first, put the combustion chamber under the crucible, put the mold on the same y level,next to the crucible. Drop the desired metal ingredients into the crucible and then feed(right click) the combustion chamber with any fuel such as coal, wood, etc. Next, right-click the combustion chamber with GT fire starter and there is a chance of starting the fire. Next, you need to wait for the metal to melt in the crucible, or for the alloy mixture to change color. Right - click the mold with your hand/wrench to get the metal. After the metal solidifies, right click again to retrieve the metal. You'll get burned if you don't use the wrench. There is a melting temperature cap in the description of %n%n crucible, if the temperature of the crucible exceeds this cap, the crucible will melt (the surrounding blocks will not be damaged, but your crucible will disappear). After this task, I suggest you first look at the temperature task next to it. %n%n molds can be made into various shapes, such as plates, ingots, rods, and gears with chisels. You can look up the tutorials for that. The exported metal product is base on the shape you make. For example, the plate is an empty out mold. This will save you a lot of time.

To make steel from a blast furnace, the ore must be thrown from the top of the blast furnace with the same amount of flux and the same or more amounts of charcoal. Each layer of the blast furnace can process four pieces of ore. Then set the blast furnace block on fire with some fire starters. %n Beware: in order to maintain high temperatures, it is recommended to maintain a charcoal to ore ratio of 1:1 or higher(excluding the first charcoal). If there is more ore than charcoal, the temperature will start to drop. Blast furnace GUI can be opened by right-clicking the blast furnace block. Thermometer: this shows the temperature of the blast furnace.The temperature can be raised by adding more charcoal or placing bellows on both sides of the blast furnace. Ore: How much unmelted ore is in the blast furnace. Charcoal: How much charcoal is in the blast furnace. Only charcoals can be used in the blast furnace! Note: make sure this bar is always equal to or higher than the ore bar! The ratio of charcoal to ore needs to be at least 1:1. With the bellows, the temperature will be kept high enough for the ore to begin to melt. The ore counter will eventually run out and fill the output counter with the finished metal. Continue heating until the iron ore melts and flows into cauldrons underneath to receive liquid pig iron. You need to use a ceramic mold to remove the melted pig iron.Just a few steps left. Forge pig iron into high carbon steel ingot on a wrought iron or better anvil. Lastly, reforge it into steel ingot.%n%n

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARA.desc=You can put the temperature sensors on the sides of the crucible. It displays the crucible's temperature in real time. You can make a screwdriver and right click on it to adjust its mode: for example, >2000K means it emits redstone signal at a temperature greater than 2000K. %n%n You can transmit the redstone signal using either redstone or red alloy cable. By connecting it to a piston or other device, blocking of the front of liquid/gas combustion chamber can instantly extinguish the combustion chamber. %n%n Note: the solid combustion chamber will still use up the fuel it was burning after it's blocked. So, before you can make a liquid/gas fuel, use a small pinch of solid fuel.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWg.name=Coke oven +
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWg.desc=You may have noticed that the vanilla furnace no longer produces charcoal, but a multi-block gt coke oven can. The coke oven is a hollow 3x3x3 cube. The front center is the main block of the coke oven, while the others are firebricks. Each coke oven requires 25 firebricks and 1 coke oven control block. I now want you to collect a lot of clay to make it. The %n%n coke oven needs to be lit by the vanilla or GregTech fire starters after putting in logs or lignite/coal, instead of the TFC fire starter, clicks on the controller to start the operation. %n the coke oven can process 16 fuels at once. A group of coal or a pure broken coal mine can be processed into a stack of cokes, the burn value is doubled, and 32000L of creosote can be obtained. More creosote can be obtained by coking lignite, but the burn value of coking lignite is lower. The wood can be processed to charcoal and considerable creosote can be obtained. %n%n Creosote is the best liquid fuel before the distillation tower is finished. Its burnn value is comparable to that of crude oil. It is easy to make and it's trash otherwise. %n%nÂ§ C Note that this task has two pages
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWw.name=Fluid combustion chamber

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZQ.name=Temperature matters
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAZQ.desc=Different crucibles have different melting temperatures, as you can see at Tooltip. This determines the maximum melting point of the metal they can smelt. Ceramic crucible, for example, could not be used to make iridium, but chrome crucible could. It's important to make a crucible with a high melting point, which allows you to make stronger metals. In general, ideal crucible tier progression is ceramic - chrome - iridium. For now, the highest level you can get is iridium. To keep the crucible from melting down, you need to make a thermometer to see the cauldron's temperature in real time. %n%n First prepare a glass bottle, then you need three cinnabar powder, drop it into the crucible, fill it with 144L liquid mercury from the crucible. Drop two planks into the combustion chamber and ignite (you can't drop too much fuel, as mercury evaporates easily), just enough to turn cinnabar into mercury, which is liquid at room temperature, so you don't have to worry about solidifying. You can obtain the mercury bottle by right-clicking the glass bottle directly at the liquid inside the crucible. Now that we've got the thermometer we can monitor the temperature of the cauldron all the time. No more melt downs!
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAag.name=Burning!!!! ~ ~
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAag.desc=The combustion chamber. The most direct way you can get heat, or HU, is also the source of heat for a steam boiler, but not just. Many of GregTech Tech's machines use heat. Until you make an electric heater, you'll need them. The heat output from the top (HU)%n%n combustion chamber is divided into solid, liquid and gas. The advantages and disadvantages of the three combustors are analyzed here. Â§4Â§lsolid combustor, using solid fuel, all fuel that can be used in a furnace (except magma) can be stuffed into a solid combustor and used as fuel. When you want to stop heating, you need to plug the front of the combustion chamber and wait for the current burning fuel to burn out. When using a solid combustion chamber for mineral smelting, be sure to wait for the fire to shut off before pouring. Because the less the contents of the crucible, the faster it heats up, if the crucible is left empty or near empty without being extinguished, the temperature will rise so rapidly that it will explode (in effect, melt). Suitable for equipment that requires long-term heating and high fault tolerance, but because of the need to manually add fuel and the need to periodically clean the ash after combustion, solid combustion Chambers are not recommended after the distillation column has been built. Â§2Â§lliquid combustor, the safest and most stable combustor, using combustible liquids: the best you can get right now is creosote (wines, creosote, and petroleum distillates are good for combustion, other oils have too low calorimetric values). Since the flammable liquid burns 1L/1ticks, when you want to stop heating, you just plug the front and stop heating immediately. When a mineral is smelted in a liquid combustion chamber, the heating can be stopped at a higher standard temperature to prevent solidification during the pouring process. %n%nÂ§9Â§lgas combustor, long - acting combustor. The calorific value of propane butane is slightly higher than the calorific value of gasoline and other petroleum distilling oil, and each combustion USES 5~7L to burn 30~42ticks, so the shutdown will be delayed by about one second. Suitable for distillation column, steam boiler and other long-term heating sources. Note: depending on the oil found, a liquid or gas combustor may be used. The heavier the oil, the less the gas, and the more the oil and solid products, and vice versa.

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACeg.desc=No one knows whether Alexander Steve II made it to Earth safely or not. If he succeeds, I think he will be very disappointed. Earth had become a desolate, desolate hell, ravaged by dust storms and acid rain. Thanks to relativity, Alexander of sublight-speed travel experienced much less time than people on Earth, at least before they left there. By rough calculation, Earth has experienced at least 400 years of history during the time of his departure. No one knows what has happened to Earth or where the human race has gone. Alexander's space station holds samples of the Earth's gene bank and 200,000 fertilized human eggs. Hope, the flame that seems to have gone out, still exists in the silent universe.

When the player is full, they get extra nutrients, and according to the player's current nutrition level, when the player is malnourished, they get more nutrients. %n%n The first four categories account for 25 percent of a player's maximum health, and dairy products have an additional 25 percent maximum health. For example, a starting player with no level is likely to reach a maximum life span of 800HP(the first four nutrients are filled).

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4w.name=Fruit
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA4w.desc=Fruits are obtained in two ways: berry bushes and fruit trees, both of which can be found in the wild. %n Berry bushes can be gathered directly by hand and cannot reproduce. When the shrub is in season and in the right temperature range, it can produce a new fruit every month. Each berry has a different life span, and at the end of that life span, the fruit is removed from the bush. To harvest the fruit, just right-click on the bush and the fruit will drop. The harvested weights vary from 3 to 8 ounces. There is a chance of getting a sapling by chopping it down with an axe. If the trunk is left, it can continue to grow, multiply and produce more. %n%n tree seedlings do not grow immediately. On the contrary, the fruit trees grow slowly, with branches and leaves coming out in stages. This means that the saplings will eventually grow back after the branches have been cut off for harvest. But it also means that saplings take a long time to grow into trees as big as those in the wild. The trunk will reach its maximum height after 30 days, with a branch every 20 days and a leaf every two days. At harvest time, the tree will have a fruit on each leaf. To harvest the fruit, right-click on the leaves or left-click on the leaves and the fruit will fall. Fruit per serving is 4 to 16 ounces. %n%n fruit trees bear fruit only when the current temperature is between 0 and 38. For most cases, the corresponding seasonal temperatures (spring to late fall) are within this range, except in deserts, equatorial jungles, and deep tundra.%n

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA5g.desc=One of the five sources of nutrition, the only way to get it is by growing grain.%n Directly harvested grains need to be processed before they can be eaten. Bake them over a fire, or use a knife to cut them into grains. If you want a grain to last longer, or if you want to make a sandwich, you should make the grain into bread. Grain grains are ground in a stone mill to make flour, which is combined with a wooden bucket to make dough, which is baked over a fire to make bread. If you grow five food crops, you get the ultimate food: bread between bread and bread between bread and bread

betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEQ.desc=Farmland, also known as soil, contains the three basic nutrients of a plant, and if there's enough water cube nearby, your plant can get important water. By using the water and nutrient pattern of the metal hoe, you can see the nutrient level of the crop and the availability of water. Growing crops in the soil reduces soil nutrients and must be fallow, fertilized, or planted periodically with crops that require different nutrient types in order to replenish nutrients. Note: Some crops, such as soybeans and green beans, require additional nutrients as they grow. %n%n Unlike the original, farmland cannot be turned back into soil. The destruction of cropland also does not produce any soil to prevent the reuse of nutrients.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEg.name=Animal husbandry: 1
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEg.desc=Chickens, cows, horses, pigs and sheep are all livestock. The natural generation of the world's animals is based on the climate of the region. %n%n livestock will follow any kind of refined grain and ear of corn, similar to the original animals will follow wheat, carrots and seeds. The rope is also the same as in the original drawing of livestock %n%n Bears, deer and pheasants are wild animals and cannot breed. Wild animals will be refreshed all over the world, except named animals, or at least tethered once, which won't disappear. All animals have a degree of intimacy that increases the need to interact in some way, such as milking, shearing, riding, raising and naming animals. The exact value of these interactions varies from species to species, and some require more interaction. Familiarity can be improved by performing specific actions every 24 game hours. To raise an animal, the player must sneak around to provide food so that the animal does not get spooked. If intimacy does not reach 30 percent and the animal does not interact with the human within 24 hours, then intimacy will decline. Adult animals are limited in their ability to be domesticated, only small animals can be fully domesticated, and intimacy increases faster. Young animals retain 50 per cent of their mother's closeness at birth, unless she is close to the maximum, in which case they will retain 90 per cent. %n%n Stealthily looking at an animal displays a closeness indicator. As the intimacy increases, the indicator will fill with red, and when it reaches 100 percent, it will turn gold. A white border means that the animal has reached at least 30 percent and intimacy is no longer diminished. %n%n Sex: %n%n animals (excluding squid) have different sex (male or female), which is determined randomly at the time of animal generation. With the exception of bears, horses and wolves, all animals have visual cues to easily determine sex, such as horns, teeth, breasts and different feather colors. For creatures with no visual cues, players can right click on the animal, and the chat window will indicate gender.
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEw.name=Animal husbandry: Reproduction
betterquesting.quest.AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABEw.desc=All reproducible animals except chickens are bred by bringing together animals of different genders and feeding them until heart-shaped particles begin to appear. The animals consumed 5 ounces of grain each time they were fed, and if both animals had the heart, they would approach within seconds of the particles disappearing. A successful breeding can be confirmed by right-clicking on the female animal, which will produce a chat message, "pregnant". %n % chicken %n%n chickens are bred by using nesting boxes. The hen will lay an egg in the nest box every day. If there is a rooster in the box, the egg will be fertilized. A fertilized egg has a hint of fertilization on it. After three quarters of a month in the nest, the fertilized eggs hatch into chicks. Note: This calculation is based on months, not days.

The %n%n event horizon represents its actual size, regardless of the block's explosive strength, once the block is within the event horizon it will be destroyed immediately (except for blocks such as bedrock), entities located within the event horizon will be eaten, and creatures located within the event horizon will be harmed. %n%n destructive power represents the hardest object it can destroy. This value is equivalent to the explosive force of an explosive. When the anti-explosive ability of the block is higher than the destructive power and it is beyond the horizon, it cannot be destroyed. Destructive power also represents the damage done to a creature each time. %n%n its main role is to power the annihilation reactor.
